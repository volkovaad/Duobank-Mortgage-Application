Feature: Using the Preapproval Details page

  As a potential homebuyer, I want to use the Preapproval Details page of my bank's mortgage application to provide the necessary information
  to get pre-approved for a mortgage loan, including information about my realtor, loan purpose, purchase price, down payment amount and percentage, loan amount, source of down payment, and additional available funds for closing costs or reserves.
